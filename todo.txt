Todo:
Add Login Functionality
	- follow blake's example (actual behavior is in userjdbc)
	- for the front-end, do some research on Context in react to handle moving the credentials around
Add view table functionality
	- Resolve reimbursement X
	- View reimbursements by author
		- backend is ready, just need to write front-end
	- Tables should display the NAME of users and status instead of their id (should be doable with a SQL JOIN in the jdbc)
		- Progress: I can display name of users, but not status yet. joining more than 2 tables is a mess
	- submitted and resolved should be displayed in readable date-time format

Beautify
	- Bootstrap grid
