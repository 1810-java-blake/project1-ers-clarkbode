Todo:
Add Login Functionality
	- Back end process for accepting/rejecting a login is done X
	- Need to do the front-end handling and check on role/session handling
	- Blake has basic functionality in his react-demo, but it would need to be modified to get any info from the server
		- POST requests can return data in the body. Experiment with this.
	- for the front-end, do some research on Context in react to handle moving the credentials around
Add view table functionality
	- Resolve reimbursement X
	- View reimbursements by author
		- backend is ready, just need to write front-end
	- Tables should display the NAME of users and status instead of their id (should be doable with a SQL JOIN in the jdbc)
		- Progress: I can display name of users, but not status yet. joining more than 2 tables is a mess
	- submitted and resolved should be displayed in readable date-time format

Beautify
	- Bootstrap grid
