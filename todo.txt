Todo:
Add Login Functionality
	- follow blake's example (actual behavior is in userjdbc)
	- for the front-end, do some research on Context in react to handle moving the credentials around
Add view table functionality
	- Resolve reimbursement
	- View reimbursements by author
	- Tables should display the NAME of users and status instead of their id (should be doable with a SQL JOIN in the jdbc)
	- submitted and resolved should be displayed in readable date-time format

Beautify
	- Bootstrap grid
